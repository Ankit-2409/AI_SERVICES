# M&G AI SERVICES
# Problem Statement

Organizations face challenges in ensuring regulatory compliance and mitigating risks associated with user interactions with AI tools like ChatGPT. Manual rule generation and monitoring processes are time-consuming and prone to errors, posing a threat to data privacy and regulatory adherence.

# Proposed Solution

To address these challenges, our solution leverages Microsoft Azure for text extraction and develops a rule-generation engine to automatically generate monitoring rules based on scanned documents and regulatory requirements. Real-time monitoring of user interactions with ChatGPT is implemented, along with risk-based alerting and prevention mechanisms. Administrators have control over rule fine-tuning through a user-friendly interface, while a blocking mechanism ensures security by temporarily blocking users with high-risk interactions.

# Business Benefits

The proposed solution offers significant business benefits, including enhanced regulatory compliance, risk mitigation, and operational efficiency. By automating rule generation and monitoring processes, organizations can ensure adherence to regulations like GDPR and mitigate the risk of data breaches. The blocking mechanism adds an extra layer of security, protecting sensitive information and preventing unauthorized access. Moreover, the projected revenue of $4.5 million reflects the potential value derived from improved compliance and risk management capabilities, contributing to organizational growth and customer trust.
